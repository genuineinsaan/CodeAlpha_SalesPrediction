# CodeAlpha_SalesPrediction

## 📈 Project: Sales Prediction using Python

This project was completed as part of my internship at **CodeAlpha**. The goal of this task was to build a regression model that predicts sales based on advertising spend across different media platforms (TV, Radio, and Newspaper).

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Predict sales based on advertising channel investment
- Apply regression modeling for business forecasting
- Analyze the relationship between ad spend and sales outcomes
- Deliver insights to guide marketing strategies

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📁 Files Included

| File Name            | Description                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `Advertising.csv`    | Dataset with advertising spend and sales    |
| `sales_prediction.py`| Python script for training & visualization  |
| `README.md`          | Project documentation file                  |

## 🧠 Features Used

- TV advertising budget (in $1000s)
- Radio advertising budget
- Newspaper advertising budget
- Target: Sales (in $1000s)

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- **TV ads** had the highest correlation with sales
- **Radio** also contributed moderately
- **Newspaper** had the least impact, suggesting low ROI
- The model predicted future sales with a high **R² Score**

---

## ✅ Outcome

This project demonstrates how machine learning can provide **actionable insights for business marketing decisions**, like where to allocate advertising budgets for best performance.
